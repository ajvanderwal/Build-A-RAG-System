An employee accrues vacation days at a rate of       days per month for full-time employees, up to       weeks vacation in the first year. Beyond the first year, full-time employees accrue       days per month leading to       weeks vacation each year. The maximum number of accrued vacation days that can be carried over to the next calendar year is limited to a specific number of days. Upon completion of one year of service, employees may take up to a maximum of       weeks vacation at one time.
