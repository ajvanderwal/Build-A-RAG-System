The company's policy on vacation time includes the following key points:
- Full-time employees start accruing vacation days from the beginning of employment at a certain rate per month, up to a specified amount, typically leading to a certain number of weeks of vacation per year.
- After six months of service, employees can take their accrued vacation with supervisor approval.
- Full-time employees continue to accrue vacation days at a set rate per month in subsequent years.
- A maximum number of accrued vacation days may be carried over from one calendar year to the next.
- Employees can take up to a maximum number of weeks of vacation at one time, subject to supervisor approval, with any excess vacation time at year-end being forfeited.
- Vacation pay is based on regular earnings, excluding overtime or additional compensation.
- Vacation time can be taken in full-day or half-day increments.
- Part-time employees accrue vacation time on a prorated basis.
- Sick leave can be used in conjunction with vacation time after sick leave is exhausted.
- Vacations and holidays can overlap, with employees still being paid for holidays.
- Absence due to illness may require contact with the supervisor regarding intentions to return to work.
- Pregnancy is considered a temporary medical disability, and a leave of absence for disability does not break service tenure but does not accrue additional sick leave or vacation time.
