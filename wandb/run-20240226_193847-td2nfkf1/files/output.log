The company provides a vacation benefits package for eligible full-time and part-time employees. Vacation days are accrued starting from the beginning of employment for full-time employees, with an increased rate after completing six months of service. Full-time employees accrue vacation days each month and can carry over a certain number of days to the next calendar year. Employees can take up to a maximum amount of vacation time per year, subject to supervisor approval. Vacation pay is based on regular earnings, and part-time employees accrue vacation time on a pro-rated basis. Additionally, employees can request to use vacation time for illness when sick leave is exhausted, and a detailed process for absence due to illness is outlined.
