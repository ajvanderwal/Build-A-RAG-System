The company's policy on vacation time includes the following guidelines:
- Full-time employees start accumulating vacation from the beginning of their employment at a specific rate per month, leading to a certain number of weeks of vacation time in the first year.
- After six months of service, employees can take their accrued vacation with supervisor approval.
- In the second year of employment and thereafter, full-time employees accrue a specific number of vacation days per month for a total number of weeks of vacation each year.
- A maximum number of vacation days can be carried over from one calendar year to the next.
- Upon completion of one year of service, employees can take up to a maximum number of weeks of vacation time at once, subject to supervisor approval.
- Eligible staff members receive vacation pay based on their regular earnings, not including additional compensation like overtime.
- Vacation time can be taken in full-day or half-day increments.
- Provisions are made for sick leave and compensatory time after sick leave is exhausted for continued absence due to illness.
- Pregnancy is considered a temporary medical disability according to the policy.
- A leave of absence for disability purposes will not break the tenure for service calculation, but no additional sick leave or vacation time will accumulate during the absence.
