The company's policy on vacation time includes allowing employees to accrue vacation days from the start of employment at a certain rate per month, with a maximum number of weeks they can take at one time, subject to supervisor approval. Employees are encouraged not to take a vacation within the first few months of employment. Full-time employees accrue vacation day credits each year, can carry over a limited number of days to the next year, and must give advance notice to supervisors for vacation requests. Vacation pay is based on regular earnings, and part-time employees accrue vacation time on a pro-rated basis. Hourly part-time employees are not eligible for vacation time. If a holiday falls during an approved vacation period, the employee will be paid for the holiday and use one less vacation day.
