The company's policy on vacation time specifies that employees start accruing vacation days from the beginning of their employment. Full-time employees accumulate vacation days at the rate of a certain number of days per month, leading to a set number of weeks of vacation time in the first year. After completing one year of service, employees may take their accrued vacation days subject to supervisor approval. The policy also outlines how vacation days increase for full-time employees in subsequent years, how many days can be carried over to the next year, the process for requesting vacation time, and the conditions under which part-time employees accrue vacation time on a pro-rated basis.
